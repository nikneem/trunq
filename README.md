## üìå Overview
Trunq is a service that accepts long URLs and returns short, shareable identifiers ("trunqs") that redirect to the original targets. It is designed for clarity, testability, and future extensibility (e.g., analytics, custom domains, rate limiting) without premature complexity.

The solution uses **.NET Aspire** for local multi‚Äëservice orchestration and follows a clean separation of responsibilities between:

| Service | Responsibility |
|---------|----------------|
| `HexMaster.Trunq.Api` | Public HTTP API surface (create/manage short links) |
| `HexMaster.Trunq.Resolver` | (Resolution layer) Redirect short codes to full targets |
| `Aspire.AppHost` | Local composition/orchestration (wiring services, telemetry defaults) |
| `ServiceDefaults` | Shared service configuration (logging, telemetry scaffolding, resilience) |

> Persistence, caching, analytics, and custom domain modules are intentionally deferred until requirements are explicit.

---

## ‚ú® Current Features
* Create short links via API (initial scaffolding)
* Structured architecture ready for persistence layer introduction
* Clear layering for future analytics & observability
* .NET 9 / C# 13 ready codebase

## üõ† Planned / Roadmap (High‚ÄëLevel)
| Phase | Item | Notes |
|-------|------|-------|
| 1 | URL validation & normalization | Enforce http/https, strip tracking params (optional) |
| 1 | Short code generation strategy | Base62 (no ambiguous chars), collision handling |
| 2 | Pluggable persistence | Start with lightweight (e.g., in‚Äëmemory / SQLite) behind abstraction |
| 2 | Resolution endpoint integration | End‚Äëto‚Äëend redirect path |
| 3 | Expiration support | Optional per‚Äëlink TTL |
| 3 | Basic metrics & tracing | OpenTelemetry spans: `shorturl.create`, `shorturl.resolve` |
| 4 | Custom slugs (user supplied) | Validation + reserved words list |
| 4 | Rate limiting / abuse prevention | Opt‚Äëin policies |
| 5 | Click analytics | Aggregation + privacy mindful design |

## üß± Architecture Principles
* **Single responsibility services** ‚Äì API vs resolver vs orchestration.
* **Abstraction before commitment** ‚Äì Introduce persistence interfaces first.
* **Secure & strict input handling** ‚Äì Only valid syntactic URLs; avoid open redirects.
* **Observability‚Äëfriendly** ‚Äì Structured logs & readiness for OpenTelemetry.
* **Extensible design** ‚Äì Small interfaces; pluggable code generation strategy.
* **Privacy aware** ‚Äì Minimize logging of raw user URLs.

		HexMaster.Trunq.Aspire.ServiceDefaults/# Shared service defaults (logging, etc.)

## üöÄ Getting Started (Local Development)

### Prerequisites
* [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) (preview if not GA)
* Node.js 20+ & npm (for the Angular frontend)
* Modern browser

### Clone
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/nikneem/trunq.git
cd trunq
```

### Restore & Build Backend
```powershell
dotnet restore .\src\Trunq.sln
dotnet build .\src\Trunq.sln -c Debug
```

### Run with Aspire AppHost
```powershell
dotnet run --project .\src\Aspire\HexMaster.Trunq.Aspire\HexMaster.Trunq.Aspire.AppHost\HexMaster.Trunq.Aspire.AppHost.csproj
```
This wires together the API (and, as it matures, the resolver) using Aspire's local orchestrator.

### Frontend (Optional / Early)
```powershell
cd .\src\Frontend
npm install
npm start  # or: npx ng serve --open
```

---

## üß™ Testing (Coming Soon)
Initial unit tests will cover:
* Short code generation (length, alphabet, collision retries)
* URL validation & normalization
* API contract behaviors (201 Created + Location header)

> When tests are added you will run them with: `dotnet test src/Trunq.sln`.

---

## üì° API Usage (Preview)
Example (subject to change as endpoints solidify):

`POST /shortlinks`
```jsonc
{
	"url": "https://example.com/some/very/long/path?with=query&tracking=123"
}
```
Response `201 Created`
```jsonc
{
	"code": "fA72kX9",
	"originalUrl": "https://example.com/some/very/long/path?with=query&tracking=123",
	"shortUrl": "https://localhost:5001/fA72kX9",
	"createdAt": "2025-08-20T12:34:56Z"
}
```
Follow the `shortUrl` (or GET `/fA72kX9`) to be redirected (302) to the stored original URL.

---

## üîê Security & Input Handling
* Only `http` / `https` schemes will be accepted initially.
* Future: optional stripping of known analytics query parameters.
* Short codes will avoid ambiguous characters (e.g., 0/O, 1/l) when readability mode is enabled.
* No secrets are stored in the repository. Keep environment‚Äëspecific values out of source.

## ü§ù Contributing
We welcome contributions of all sizes‚Äîfrom typo fixes to architectural features.

### Quick Start (Happy Path)
1. Fork the repo & create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/meaningful-name`
2. Make focused changes (keep diffs tight)
3. Add or update tests (if the behavior is observable)
4. Run build + tests locally
5. Open a Pull Request (PR) referencing any related issue

### Commit Style
Use clear, imperative commit messages (present tense). Examples:
* `Add URL normalization utility`
* `Refactor short code generator to support custom alphabet`

### PR Expectations
* Describe motivation & context
* Include before/after behavior if relevant
* Note any breaking changes explicitly
* Keep PRs under ~400 lines net change where practical (split bigger work)

### Development Guidance
* Follow existing namespace & file‚Äëscoped conventions
* Prefer small interfaces rather than premature frameworks
* Avoid introducing external dependencies without prior discussion (open an issue first)
* Do **not** log full sensitive URLs‚Äîtruncate if added to logs

See detailed guidance in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).
